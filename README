Elderly Care Cost and Planning (ECCAP) Calculator is a tool for determining
the affordable length of stay in different living options or care-facilities
and an elderly person or their care-givers may be considering.

It was done as a proposal to a joint project between FINRA (http://finra.org)
and the University of Michigan Senior Housing Bureau.

The initial release of this calculator is for demo purposes only.  It is offered
as-is.  It's results have not been independently verified by a CPA.  Westside
Consulting LLC takes no responsibility for the results or for any decisions 
based on its results.

The calcuator is initially seeded with some demo numbers for getting started.

When FINRA provides funding for this work, Westside will provide a database 
with secure user accounts for saving and restoring calculations and results.
